# Functionality:
## The function attempts to find the optimal selection of items that maximize the total benefit without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack. It uses principles of natural selection, including population generation, fitness evaluation, crossover, and mutation.

# Parameters:
 * weights: A list of item weights.
 * benefits: A list of corresponding item benefits.
 * capacity: The maximum weight the knapsack can hold.
 * num_generations (default: 100): The number of iterations for the algorithm.
 * pop_size (default: 50): The size of the population in each generation.
 * mutation_rate (default: 0.01): The probability of mutating each gene in a chromosome.
