### The function attempts to find the optimal selection of items that maximize the total benefit without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack. It uses principles of natural selection, including population generation, fitness evaluation, crossover, and mutation.

# Parameters:
 * weights: A list of item weights.
 * benefits: A list of corresponding item benefits.
 * capacity: The maximum weight the knapsack can hold.
 * num_generations (default: 100): The number of iterations for the algorithm.
 * pop_size (default: 50): The size of the population in each generation.
 * mutation_rate (default: 0.01): The probability of mutating each gene in a chromosome.
# Process:
## 1. Population Initialization:
  * The function starts by generating a random population of binary chromosomes (generate_population).
  * Each chromosome represents a potential solution to the problem (1 means the item is selected, 0 means it is not).
## 2. Fitness Evaluation:
  * The fitness of each chromosome is computed using evaluate_fitness.
  * If the total weight of a chromosome exceeds the capacity, its fitness is set to 0.
## 3. Selection:
  * Parents are selected using Roulette Wheel Selection, where chromosomes with higher fitness values are more likely to be chosen.
## 4. Crossover:
  * A single-point crossover is performed between two selected parents to produce two offspring.
## 5. Mutation:
  * A small random mutation is applied to each offspring to introduce variability and help avoid local optima.
## 6. Population Update:
  * The next generation is formed by replacing the old population with the offspring.
## 7. Final Solution:
  * After all generations, the chromosome with the highest fitness is returned as the best solution.
# Return Value:
### The function returns a dictionary containing:
   * total_benefit: The maximum benefit achieved.
   * selected_items: Indices of the items included in the solution.
   * solution: The binary representation of the best chromosome
